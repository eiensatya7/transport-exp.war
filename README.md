Note : gitignore has *.jar..

todo:
1. after login user should directly come to book cabs page not welcome page
2. when a user is in a page corresponding link should get highlighted in the menu. So after login 'Book Cab' should be highlighted. the highlighted style is '.rich-menu-item a:active ' in theme.css
3. bind booking type selector(point to point,airport...) actions from radio buttons to 'a' tags.
4. move testimonials to , under select your booking pane in book cab page.
5. move change password to profile page (may be under some edit profile)
6. check the new menu with the older one and see if any links are left out. 'home' link is not needed, change default pages for logged in(same as point 1) and not logged in user.
7. try to divide date and time into separate input boxes as shown in design(i've already added html and css in place). it adds to better design. but if its not possible or hard remove ' pickup time' and change 'pickup date' to 'pickup date and time'.
8. for 'search cabs' button try to added search icon (i will explain further when you reach this).
9. after clicking 'search cabs', the site should auto scroll to results.
10. Apply the same styles to all the pages, for any anomalies contact me and we can fix it then and there.
11. check that none of the functionality is broken anywhere.
